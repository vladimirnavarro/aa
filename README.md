###  Introduction to Lexer:

A lexer, also known as a lexical analyzer, is a fundamental component of a compiler or interpreter that is responsible for analyzing the stream of characters from a source program and dividing it into meaningful tokens. These tokens are basic language units such as keywords, identifiers, numbers, and symbols.

###  Importance of Lexer:

The lexer breaks down the source code into tokens, making it easier for subsequent processing by the compiler or interpreter. By separating the code into more manageable parts, the lexer simplifies the task of syntactic and semantic analysis, thus helping to detect errors and facilitating the generation of intermediate code or direct execution of the program.

An efficient and accurate lexer is essential to ensure that the source code is parsed correctly and translated appropriately into executable instructions. Additionally, the design of the lexer can significantly affect the performance and maintainability of the compiler or interpreter overall.
